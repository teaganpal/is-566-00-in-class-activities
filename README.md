# In-Class Exercises for IS 566
Welcome to IS 566! This (public) repository is where I'll share various starter files and other code that we use in class. You'll probably want to clone this repository so that it lives alongside your own assignment repository folders. 

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Most students like to enter code along with me as we go through things in class. If you do this, I recommend saving a copy of your local file within the `my_work` subfolder. Anything in this subfolder will be ignored by git, so this will help you avoid annoying merge conflicts that can happen if I make any changes to files you've already pulled down.
